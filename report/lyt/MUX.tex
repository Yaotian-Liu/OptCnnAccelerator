\subsection{MUX}

The MUX is a module, acting like a regular multiplexer but with a more developed function, providing a further serialization of the outputs from MAC. However, relevant introduction in the paper is far from accurate and detailed, and the figure is also a little deceptive.

According to the paper, \textit{"Since Poy $<$ Nkx × Nky × Nif for all the layers, we serialize the Pox × Poy × Pof MAC outputs into Poy cycles."} But actually, if

\begin{equation*}
    N \times Poy < \mathrm{Min}(Nkx \times Nky \times Nif)
\end{equation*}

where Nkx, Nky, Nif are the shape of filters, then there can be a N times folded serialization.

So in our final design, according to our design variables, where N can be equal to Pof, only one MUX is used to greatly save the use of following calculation units.
